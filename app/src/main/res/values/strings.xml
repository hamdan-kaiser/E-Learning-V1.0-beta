    <string name="introText">The digital classroom (see also E-Learning, blended learning and smart classroom)
        refers to the "Technology-enabled" classroom where student learning and interaction with the instructor
        and peers is fully supported through strategic use of information and communication technologies (ICTs).
        As these terms are not well-defined, they are used inaccurately so be aware. The E-Learning, for its part,
        is defined as a learning model where students receive instruction online but critique and apply their
        newly-acquired knowledge in the classroom with their peers. In that sense, the E-Learning is inherently
        social but also efficient. Blended learning is a combination of elements of face-to-face instruction and
        online instruction; online instruction may be provided by using social media, online learning platforms,
        systems and tools; students work together under the guidance of instructors to apply their new knowledge
        to complex problems.\n\nIn education from K-12 and in the post-secondary years, the digital classroom has come
        to mean a wide range of initiatives and processes, and may include digital tools and gadgets as a part of
        the learning space or environment. This space may or may not include digital archives and repositories,
        remote access to information and communications technologies (ICTs) and access to infrastructure, improved
        access to education, buildings to accommodate alternative or contested perspectives, peer knowledge
        communities and knowledge production, and non-canonical material and experiences into formal institutions of education.
        The digital classroom is often thought to be a virtualization of classrooms where virtual and immersive
        tools are part of learning structure and the methods associated with learning. This is not necessarily the case,
        as it depends on the authors and educators who form their own definition of the term.\n\n</string>
